# Earthquake-rupture
In the first folder, "Previous ruptures in GIS", the rupture areas of the earthquakes in 1940, 1966, 1974, and 2007 occurring in the subduction zone along the Coast of Lina, Peru, are provided in a GIS format. The boundaries of the tectonic region of analysis shown in black in Figure 1 in Ceferino et al. (2019) are also provided in GIS format. In the second folder "Scripts", Matlab scripts to reproduce the rupture simulation in Ceferino et al. (2019) are provided.
